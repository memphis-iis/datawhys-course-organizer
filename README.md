## Welcome!

The internship will have two phases, lasting 5 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively.
In the first phase, you will work through a loosely structured course to learn data science.
In the second phase, you will work in teams on a real data science project.

Because the internship is online, it is very important for you to become familiar with the technologies we will be using to stay connected:

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-course-organizer/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Schedule

Your schedule for the first five weeks will be very similar every day.
The only major differences are Tuesdays, when you will have lunch with a faculty member (online) and Thursdays, when we will have a presentation.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-course-organizer/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
