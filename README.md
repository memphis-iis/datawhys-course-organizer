## Welcome!

The internship will have two phases, lasting 5 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively.
In the first phase, you will work through a loosely structured course to learn data science.
In the second phase, you will work in teams on a real data science project.

Because the internship is online, it is very important for you to become familiar with the technologies we will be using to stay connected:

### Schedule

Your schedule for the first five weeks will be very similar every day.
The only major differences are Tuesdays, when you will have lunch with a faculty member (online) and Thursdays, when we will have a presentation.

Remember you can always ask questions in Slack if you're not sure what to do or if something isn't working.

In the second phase, you will be working with your project team and faculty mentor, who will set your team's schedule.
